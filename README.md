This repository provides a custom hook for implementing pagination in a React application. The hook takes in the total number of items and the number of items per page as arguments, as well as an optional page number (defaulting to one if not set). The hook returns the index of the first item on the current page, the total number of pages, and the count of total items. This custom hook can be used whenever pagination is needed, providing a reusable and efficient solution to implement pagination in a React application.
